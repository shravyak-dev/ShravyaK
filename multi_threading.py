#multi threading
# Threading is a technique where a program can run multiple operations (tasks) concurrently (at the same time) using threads.

#     A thread is the smallest unit of a program that can be executed independently.

#     Python has a built-in module called threading to work with threads.

#     A thread shares the same memory space as other threads in the same process


# Multithreading is the process of running multiple threads at the same time within the same program.

#     print(f"square numbers")
#     for i in numbers:
#         print(f"square of {i} is {i**2}")
# list_1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
# square(list_1)


# def cubes(numbers):
#     print(f"cubes numbers")
#     for i in numbers:
#         print(f"cubes of {i} is {i**3}")
# list_1 = [1,2,3,4,5]

#  Main Reason:

#     To do multiple tasks at the same time (concurrently) within a single program.


# Use Case Example	Why Threads Are Useful
# Downloading multiple files	All downloads run in parallel

# Threads are used to run multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for one to finish — making your program faster and more responsive.
